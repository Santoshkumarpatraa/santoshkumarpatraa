## Hi there 👋 I'm Santosh

Backend Developer with **3+ years of experience** building scalable, production-grade systems using **JavaScript (Node.js)** and **Sails.js**. I specialize in clean API design, third-party integrations, and complex data workflows across cloud environments.

I’ve worked extensively with **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch**, managing multi-datastore architectures and optimizing backend performance for high-traffic applications. My experience includes secure authentication, payment and tax integrations, real-time WebSocket features, and cloud-native deployments on **AWS (EKS, Docker)**.

I enjoy working close to system internals—clean architecture, async processing, background jobs, and reliable deployments. Comfortable owning features end-to-end, from API design and testing to production monitoring and scaling.
