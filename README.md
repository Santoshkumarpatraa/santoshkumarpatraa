## Hi there 👋 I'm Santosh

Backend Developer with **3+ years of experience** building scalable, production-grade systems using **JavaScript (Node.js)** and **Sails.js**. I specialize in designing robust APIs, integrating third-party services, and handling complex data workflows across multiple databases and cloud environments.

I’ve worked extensively with **PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Elasticsearch**, managing multi-datastore architectures and optimizing backend performance for high-traffic applications. My experience includes secure authentication systems, payment and tax integrations, real-time WebSocket features, and cloud-native services deployed on **AWS (EKS, Docker)**.

I enjoy working close to system internals—clean architecture, async processing, background jobs, and reliable deployments. Comfortable owning features end-to-end, from API design and testing to production monitoring and scaling.
